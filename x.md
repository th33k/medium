| **Definition**     | A computer system designed to perform a dedicated function, often with real-time constraints, and integrated into a larger mechanical or electrical system. | A network of embedded systems/devices with sensors, actuators, and connectivity to exchange data and enable intelligent decision-making via the internet. |
| **Core Purpose**   | Task-specific operation within a closed system.                                                                                                             | Inter-device communication and data exchange for smart automation and analytics.                                                                          |
| **Connectivity**   | Typically isolated or uses local interfaces (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C).                                                                                         | Connected to internet/cloud via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.                                                                                            |
| **Communication**  | No or limited communication with other systems.                                                                                                             | Constant communication with other devices or cloud platforms.                                                                                             |
| **Control Access** | Controlled locally (e.g., via onboard buttons or interfaces).                                                                                               | Controlled remotely via mobile/web applications.                                                                                                          |
| **Data Handling**  | Processes and uses data internally.                                                                                                                         | Sends data to cloud/servers, processes remotely or locally, then acts on it.                                                                              |
| **Examples**       | Microwave, digital watch, printer, car ECU.                                                                                                                 | Smart fridge, Alexa, smart irrigation system, fitness tracker.                                                                                            |
